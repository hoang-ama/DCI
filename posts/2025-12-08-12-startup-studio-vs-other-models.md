What is make a startup studio different from other startup creation models like incubators, accelerators, and venture capital firms? This article explores the distinctions between these models and highlights the unique aspects of startup studios.

### Summary
A startup studio systematically builds companies from scratch, acting as a co-founder with deep involvement, unlike VCs (invest in existing ideas), accelerators (support pre-existing startups with funding/mentorship for equity), or incubators (offer space/resources to early ideas). Studios generate ideas internally, provide all resources (funding, teams, tech), and take significant equity, sharing risk and reward as true partners, which differs from the more hands-off or external validation approach of other models. 

### 1. Business Idea Generation
- Startup studios generate and validate their own business ideas internally, while other models typically work with pre-existing startups.

### 2. Act as Co-Founder
- Startup studios take an active role in building the startup from the ground up, often taking significant equity and sharing risk/reward as true partners
- Provides resources: They offer a variety of resources, including initial funding, experienced personnel, and infrastructure to develop the company
- Other models play as investors or mentors, providing funding or support but not directly building the company

### 3. Operational Involvement
- Studio teams are deeply involved in all aspects of a startup, such as strategy, product development, marketing, and operations.
- Other models tend to be more hands-off, providing mentorship or funding but not direct operational support.

### 4. Strategic Guidance
- Startup studios typically employ an internal team of experienced entrepreneurs and investors who are assigned to build the new ventures.
- Other models may provide access to mentors or advisors but do not have a dedicated internal team working on the startup.

### 5. Finacial Capital
- Startup studios provide initial funding and resources to their startups, often taking a significant equity stake.
- Other models may provide funding in exchange for equity (VCs, accelerators) or offer resources without direct investment (incubators).

### 6. Office Space
- Incubators often provide physical office space and infrastructure to early-stage startups.
- VCs and Accelerators typically do not provide physical space.
- Startup studios normally have the co-working spaces where their teams and startups can collaborate.

### 7. Ecosystem and Network
- Accelerators often provide access to a network of mentors, investors, and industry connections.
- VCs provide access to their investor networks but do not typically offer operational support.
- Incubators may offer some networking opportunities but are more focused on providing resources.
- Startup studios consistently collaborate with their ecosystems to provide support for the startups they create.

### Conclusion
Startup studios are a unique model for building startups that leverage shared resources, internal ideation, and hands-on involvement to increase the chances of success for new ventures. They differ significantly from incubators, accelerators, and venture capital firms in their approach to startup creation and support.
