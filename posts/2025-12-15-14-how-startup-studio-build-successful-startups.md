There are different implementations of the studio approach, depending on who the founders are, what the vision of the organization is. But the recipe is similar. 
### Steps
Here are the common steps to build a startup studio:
- Take a core team & entrepreneurs in residence.
- Add shared infrastructure & in-house funding.
- Generate ideas internally, or in some cases, act as a cofounder.
- Build multiple startups in parallel.
- Trash what doesn’t work, reassign team – so you keep all the expertise.
- Spin off what works into a dedicated company.
- Grow. Exit. Repeat

### Advantages
Compared to the old startup building recipe, startup studios make early-stage building easier:
- You have a team of experienced company builders.
- The studio provides a safety net, reducing the risk of failure.
- Because the team sticks together even if an idea fails, their experience grows, they become even better builders.
- A studio is perfect for quick, low-cost experimentation.
- You build trusted relationship with investors, so getting follow-on investments for your portfolio companies becomes easier.

### Challenges and risks
- Capital Intensity: You will need a large initial investment to build up a full core team and pay for the infrastructure & resources of many projects at the same time. Or you will have to settle for a slower startup building speed.
- Capital Intensity:Startup studios as an institutional shareholder usually have a large portion of the equity, often exceeding 50%. From an outsider’s point of view this might raise a red flag. What they don’t always see at first is, that the studio is not just a shareholder, but the main founder in the startup. But fact remains that the dedicated team of the startup will have less equity than in traditional startups. And that raises questions about their motivation, incentives.
The solution is simple: Hire people who want to have the benefits of a studio and accept the tradeoff in equity. There are plenty of young entrepreneurs out there who are passionate about building a business - and who have the ability to commit to an idea that they together decide on with the startup studio. 
- Convincing investors for the first time: Because of the above, investors who have no previous experience with studios might be skeptic. To convince them of the worth and value add of the studio, one has to show the investors how the studio will continue to contribute to the startup’s success even after spin-off.
Also, it’s common to give more equity to the startup team in later fundraising stages (from the studio’s shares) to uphold their motivation
- Authenticity: Some worry that studio teams, “hired guns” won’t be able to build an authentic startup. They argue that if you aren’t working on your own idea, then you won’t be fanatic about it and able to put in all the needed work.
As I see it, this is only true if you are dealing with one-trick ponies. I know many talented and experienced entrepreneurs who are passionate about entrepreneurship and venture building itself as well as many people who want to build a career as a professional CEO. Finally, the studio and founders themselves will be a great source of authenticity
- Internal Competition: Scarce central resources within a studio will lead to occasional conflict between your startups. To manage this, the Leaders of the organization need to set clear guidelines on how startups can access your core teams and what the default priorities are. Encourage regular discussions, for example Scrum-like standup meetings, so every team member and startup is aware of current priorities and expected incoming work. Build and maintain a cooperative environment and work culture.
