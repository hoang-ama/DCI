No-code tools are lowering the barrier to building digital products.

### Summary
- No-code accelerates prototyping and empowers non-technical builders.
- Not a replacement for engineers, but complements development workflows.
- Choose no-code for speed-to-market and validation; migrate when scale or complexity demands it.

### Key Points
- Rapid iteration and prototyping for product teams.
- Great for internal tools, MVPs, and marketing automations.
- Consider technical debt and exportability when choosing a platform.

### Detailed Discussion
- Use cases: internal dashboards, landing pages, workflows, and simple apps.
- Risk management: maintain data export options and clear ownership of integrations.

### Conclusion
No-code platforms democratize product creation—pick the right tool for the job and plan migration when necessary.
