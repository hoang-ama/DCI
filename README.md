### IV. About Us Page Content

This page defines DCI’s operational model and investment approach.

#### IV.A. The Studio Model: Building Startups at Scale

DCI operates as a startup studio, meaning it aims to repeatedly build portfolio companies in parallel.

*   **Definition:** A startup studio (also known as a venture builder or startup factory) is a structure whose aim is to **repeatedly build products into companies**. Unlike incubators or accelerators, studios generally **generate ideas internally** and act as an institutional co-founder.
*   **Core Operating Principles:** Studios use a reusable infrastructure of resources and a cross-disciplinary core management team. This model involves: taking a core team; adding shared infrastructure and in-house funding; generating ideas internally; **building multiple startups in parallel**; and, if an idea fails, reassigning the team to a new project.
*   **DCI’s Advantage:** The studio model provides a safety net, reducing the risk of failure, and allows for **faster startup build time**. DCI leverages a model where the studio acts as the **"3rd Co-founder model"**, providing specialized expertise in marketing, design, and development.
*   **Success Metrics:** Startups founded out of studios are more likely to succeed than traditional startups. Studio companies typically reach **Series A metrics within 12 months**, and studios aim for high ownership (30% or more) early in the venture lifecycle.

#### IV.B. Team & Approach

*   **Investment Taste & Stage:** DCI has an **early stage focus**, looking for pioneering business models at the **proof-of-concept stage** and moving toward market fit. Investment decisions are based on the goal of creating the **ecosystem** (Synergy investment).
*   **Strategic Role:** DCI functions as a **strategic investor**, not just a financial investor. This involves **active participation in the operation process** to support the business until the growth stage.
*   **Talent Strategy:** We choose **experienced and qualified entrepreneurs** to partner with and invest in seed funding. A crucial approach is sharing the enough majority of shares with the executive team (CEO and key person) to ensure they are highly motivated to work.
*   **Ecosystem Management:** Each portfolio company actively grows business in its segment, but benefits from the strength of the collective portfolio with coordination from DC Invest. **DC Invest acts as the unit to raise capital and invest** for the companies in the portfolio.

### V. Blog Page Content

The Blog page serves as a repository for news and updates, demonstrating DCI's commitment to thought leadership and transparency.

*   **Content Type:** Articles covering **Industry Trends**, **Lessons Learned from Portfolio Companies**, and **Market Insights** related to the focus verticals (Sharing, Green, Circular Economies).
*   **Example Topics:** Insights into digital transformation in Vietnam, how the sharing economy promotes resource efficiency, or details on actively participating in operations with portfolio CEOs.
