Which ones are best for launching a startup? 
This is a touch question for many entrepreneurs. But there is one model that has been gaining traction in recent years: the startup studio.
This article explores the concept of a startup studio, its key characteristics, and how it differs from other startup creation models.
> A startup studio, also known as a startup factory, or a startup foundry, or a venture studio, is a studio-like company that aims at building several startup companies in succession. This style of business building is referred to as "parallel entrepreneurship".

### Summary
- A startup studio is a structure that <strong> builds </strong> startups from <strong> scratch </strong>. 
- Startup studios typically generate business ideas internally and then <strong> partner with entrepreneurs </strong> to co-found these ideas with them. 
- They are <strong> hands-on </strong> and directly involved in every aspect of a startup’s development, including strategy, product, marketing, HR, and operations. 
- They provide resources like <strong> funding, mentorship, and infrastructure </strong> to their companies.

### 1. Internal Ideation
- Builds from scratch: Startup studios generate and validate their own business ideas internally.

### 2. Shared Resource
- Provides resources: They offer a variety of resources, including initial funding, experienced personnel, and infrastructure to develop the company.

### 3. Hands-on Involvement
- Active role: Studio teams are deeply involved in all aspects of a startup, such as strategy, product development, marketing, and operations.

### 4. Core Team
- Internal team: Studios typically employ an internal team of experienced entrepreneurs and investors who are assigned to build the new ventures.

### 5. Parallel Startups
- Parallel entrepreneurship: This is a model where a single organization creates multiple startups at the same time, in parallel, rather than sequentially.

### Conclusion
Startup studios are a unique model for building startups that leverage shared resources, internal ideation, and hands-on involvement to increase the chances of success for new ventures.`

What is make a startup studio different from other startup creation models like incubators, accelerators, and venture capital firms? This article explores the distinctions between these models and highlights the unique aspects of startup studios.

### Summary
A startup studio systematically builds companies from scratch, acting as a co-founder with deep involvement, unlike VCs (invest in existing ideas), accelerators (support pre-existing startups with funding/mentorship for equity), or incubators (offer space/resources to early ideas). Studios generate ideas internally, provide all resources (funding, teams, tech), and take significant equity, sharing risk and reward as true partners, which differs from the more hands-off or external validation approach of other models. 

### 1. Business Idea Generation
- Startup studios generate and validate their own business ideas internally, while other models typically work with pre-existing startups.

### 2. Act as Co-Founder
- Startup studios take an active role in building the startup from the ground up, often taking significant equity and sharing risk/reward as true partners.
- Provides resources: They offer a variety of resources, including initial funding, experienced personnel, and infrastructure to develop the company.
- Other models play as investors or mentors, providing funding or support but not directly building the company.

### 3. Operational Involvement
- Studio teams are deeply involved in all aspects of a startup, such as strategy, product development, marketing, and operations.
- Other models tend to be more hands-off, providing mentorship or funding but not direct operational support.

### 4. Strategic Guidance
- Startup studios typically employ an internal team of experienced entrepreneurs and investors who are assigned to build the new ventures.
- Other models may provide access to mentors or advisors but do not have a dedicated internal team working on the startup.

### 5. Finacial Capital
- Startup studios provide initial funding and resources to their startups, often taking a significant equity stake.
- Other models may provide funding in exchange for equity (VCs, accelerators) or offer resources without direct investment (incubators).

### 6. Office Space
- Incubators often provide physical office space and infrastructure to early-stage startups.
- VCs and Accelerators typically do not provide physical space.
- Startup studios normally have the co-working spaces where their teams and startups can collaborate.

### 7. Ecosystem and Network
- Accelerators often provide access to a network of mentors, investors, and industry connections.
- VCs provide access to their investor networks but do not typically offer operational support.
- Incubators may offer some networking opportunities but are more focused on providing resources.
- Startup studios consistently collaborate with their ecosystems to provide support for the startups they create.

### Conclusion
Startup studios are a unique model for building startups that leverage shared resources, internal ideation, and hands-on involvement to increase the chances of success for new ventures. They differ significantly from incubators, accelerators, and venture capital firms in their approach to startup creation and support.`

    detail: `
Startup Studios have been around for some time and the business model has come a long way since its inception, which can be traced all the way back to Bill Gross​, who founded Idealab in 1996.

### Summary
- The startup studio model has evolved through several waves since its inception in the 1990s.
- Each wave has brought new approaches and focuses, adapting to changing technologies and market trends.
- From Idealab's initial concept to the present day, startup studios have continually refined their approach to building successful startups.    

### 1. First Wave 
Idealab’s initial concept was further developed with the advent of the first wave of venture studios in the early 2000s. Studios realized that it would be more beneficial to provide funding to their own startups, rather than having to attract and raise external capital.

### 2. Second Wave
From 2009 onwards, the second wave of venture studios brought on a new digital edge to the entrepreneurial support ecosystem, offering additional services with the rise of web hosting, APIs, and social media marketing.

### 3. Third Wave
In 2013, the third wave started to make a breakthrough with its lean startup methodology, prioritizing on-demand mobile services and data as valuable assets. This wave also saw the rise of corporate venture studios, where large companies created their own studios to foster innovation and develop new products or services.

### 4. Fourth Wave and Beyond
In 2015, the fourth wave of venture studios emerged focusing on a long-term vision that leverages disruptive technology to create even more resilient, sustainable, and value-generating startups.

### Conclusion
The evolution of startup studios reflects the changing landscape of entrepreneurship and innovation. From their inception in the 1990s to the present day, startup studios have adapted to new technologies and market trends, continually refining their approach to building successful startups. As the entrepreneurial ecosystem continues to evolve, startup studios are likely to play an increasingly important role in fostering innovation and driving economic growth.
