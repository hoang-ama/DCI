Fundamentals, use-cases, and considerations beyond cryptocurrency.

### Summary
- Blockchain offers tamper-evident ledgers useful for trust minimization.
- Not all problems need a blockchain—evaluate decentralization vs centralized alternatives.
- Focus on real-world use cases with clear incentives.

### Key Points
- Core components: consensus, cryptography, and distributed storage.
- Use-cases: supply chain provenance, identity, and tokenized assets.
- Challenges: scalability, UX, and regulatory clarity.

### Detailed Discussion
- When to use: multiple parties need a shared, auditable record without a central authority.
- Integration: layer blockchain where it adds trust; use off-chain systems for heavy computation.

### Conclusion
Blockchain can solve niche but high-impact problems when designed with user experience and real incentives in mind.
