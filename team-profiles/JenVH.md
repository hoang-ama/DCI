Jen VuHuong serves as Chief Soul Evolution (CSE) at DCI, stewarding the inner foundation of founders, leaders, and ventures as they grow.
While capital builds companies, soul evolution builds leaders who can carry companies through time. Jen’s role is to ensure that growth at DCI is not only fast or scalable — but aligned, conscious, and sustainable.

### Overview
With over 15 years of experience working with founders, investors, and leadership communities across 50+ countries, Jen specializes in guiding early-stage and scaling leaders through the identity shifts required for real venture-building — from idea-holder to founder, from operator to leader, from ambition to responsibility.

At DCI, Jen leads:
- Founder inner alignment & leadership evolution
- Purpose–strategy coherence during venture formation
- Decision clarity under pressure and growth
- Long-term resilience at both personal and organizational levels

Jen works closely with founders during the most fragile phases of venture building, helping them integrate:
- Vision with execution
- Values with performance
- Ambition with responsibility

Her approach blends coaching, systems thinking, behavioral insight, and deep human presence, ensuring founders grow without losing themselves — and companies scale without breaking their core.

As CSE, Jen is not a controller of direction, but a guardian of alignment — holding the question:
“Who must the founder become for this company to truly succeed?”
