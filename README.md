## 🔗 Component Linking (HTML, CSS, and JS)

The website uses a standard linking methodology for modern web development, ensuring styles are loaded early and scripts are deferred to the end of the document body for optimal performance (non-blocking render).

### 1. CSS Linking
All stylesheets are linked in the `<head>` section of the HTML files.
* **Global Styles:** Every page links to the global stylesheet:
    ```html
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
    ```
* **Panel Styles:** Pages featuring the dynamic side panels (`team.html`, `companies.html`, `investor.html`, `founder.html`) additionally include `panel_style.css`:
    ```html
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="panel_style.css">
    ```

### 2. JavaScript Linking
Scripts are loaded just before the closing `</body>` tag to ensure the DOM is fully loaded before the scripts attempt to manipulate it.

* **For pages with interactive panels (e.g., `team.html`):**
    The `panel_script.js` is typically included first as it contains the data and core functions (`markdownToHTML`, `openPanel`, etc.) used by various DOM manipulation logic, followed by `script.js` (which handles generic utility like the mobile menu and blog rendering).
    ```html
    <script src="panel_script.js"></script>
    <script src="script.js"></script>
    ```
* **For simple content pages (e.g., `contact.html`, `about.html`):**
    Only the main logic file is needed:
    ```html
    <script src="script.js"></script>
    ```

### 3. Data Flow
* **Markdown to HTML:** The contents of `companies/*.md` and `team-profiles/*.md` are read by fetch requests in **`panel_script.js`** (or **`script.js`** for blog posts) and converted into HTML using the embedded `markdownToHTML` utility function before being injected into the respective detail panels.
* **Dynamic Grids:** **`panel_script.js`** uses data arrays (`companiesData`, `teamMembers`) to dynamically render the grids on `companies.html` and `team.html`.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run this project locally:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [repository-url]
    cd DCI-website
    ```
2.  **Run with a Local Server:**
    Because the site uses `fetch` to load local Markdown (`*.md`) files, you must use a simple local web server to avoid browser security restrictions (CORS/file protocol).
    * **Recommended:** Use the **Live Server** extension in VS Code.
    * **Alternative (Python):** Run the following command in the project root directory:
        ```bash
        python3 -m http.server
        ```
3.  **Access:** Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000` (or the address provided by your server).
